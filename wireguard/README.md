WireGuard. A fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel

Itâ€™s tiny (few thousand lines of code), secure, and pretty fast. Easy yet powerful. I love it.

WireGuard is also available for other platforms, including mobiles.
There are C, Golang and other implementations.
Please add details below for the platform(s) you are familiar with!


Linux
=====
Linux Kernel module via repo/DKMS, in 5.6 kernel

Ensuring that WireGuard is always running:
- sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
- sudo systemctl daemon-reload
- sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service

Ubuntu
------
Built-in with Ubuntu 20.04, in 5.4 kernel (Canonical backported the 5.6 stuff)
If you're on Ubuntu you don't need a separate repo, from 18.04 you can just do apt install wireguard
