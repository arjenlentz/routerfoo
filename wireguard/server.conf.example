# WireGuard (WG) server config (save as /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf)
# by Arjen Lentz, arjen (at) lentz (dot) com (dot) au

# WG is peer-to-peer, but you'd have something like this on a router.

# This file is complete, it's literally all you need to make this work.
# Note: you will require some firewall rules, of course.

# To ensure that WireGuard is always on:
# sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service

# Reminder how easy it is to generate private and pub key...
# wg genkey | tee server-private.sec | wg pubkey > server-public.key
