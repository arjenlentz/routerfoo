I mentioned logging before dropping, as we don't want to just blindly drop stuff.
Logging is to syslog.

Logging everything in this rule target:
-A mPRE_LOGDROP -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables mPRE: " --log-level 5
-A mPRE_LOGDROP -j DROP

or if you want only a sample rather than everything, add this:
   -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 20

My naming scheme:
 - m for Mangle table
 - PRE = PREROUTING, POST = POSTROUTING, FWD = FORWARD, etc

For some/most filters, after a while, you can just change it to DROP without logging. You'll still see the counter.
