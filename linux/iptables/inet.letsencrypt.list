# An ipset network allow list for Let's Encrypt
# Networks we want to allow traffic from, bypassing the country blocks
# Last updated 2021-04-30
# Note that using DNS-01 validation is the better way.

# In iptables, be very specific: port 80 on a particular server.
# So then, anything getting through from these networks will just be to port 80 on your web server, that's quite limited.
# The identified network blocks are huge.
# We'll just do a /24 around the IPs we saw, is ok if the IPs don't change too often.
